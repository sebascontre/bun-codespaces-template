# bun-codespaces-template

This is a simple starter template for Bun projects in Github Codespaces, created with `bun init` (Bun v1.2.17).

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast JavaScript runtime.

Dependencies should install automatically in Codespaces. If they don't, run `bun install`.

Use `bun dev` to start the app with hot reload, or `bun start` to run it normally. Both commands run `index.ts`.
